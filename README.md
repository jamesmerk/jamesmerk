# About Me

Hi! My name is James Merk. I am a Full-Stack Web Developer and Freelancer with over 2 years of professional experience building websites and web applications. I specialize in the LAMP stack within the WordPress and WooCommerce ecosystem, but also enjoy working with the MERN stack as well.

My company TriForge Solutions specializes in Web-Development, E-Commerce and SaaS solutions for small business owners. I am proud to have worked with many amazing clients from around the world.

In my personal portfolio at [jamesmerk.com](https://jamesmerk.com/), you will find a range of websites and applications. Some with a back-end focus, and others with a front-end focus. I love learning new technologies and overcoming the challenges that arise with every project!

Outside of work, I am a Co-Organizer for [Self-Taught Software Developers](https://www.meetup.com/Philadelphia-Self-Taught-Developers-Meetup-Group) - a meet up group founded to help aspiring and experienced self-taught programmers. I am passionate about learning from and helping others, as well as giving the advice I wish I had when I started my career. When I am not coding, you will find me writing music with my band, gaming, or playing soccer with my little sister.
